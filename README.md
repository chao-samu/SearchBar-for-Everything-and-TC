# RainmeterSkin: SearchBar Everything + TC
This is a small little Rainmeter search bar skin for the program "Everything" and "Total Commander"
to make fast searches on specified drives and folder or files directly from the desktop.

The Skin is inspired from "[Search+](http://bgd69.deviantart.com/art/Search-425781470)" skin by Bgd69.

Special thanks goes to Christian Gishler for the permission to use his "Total Commander" Icon and
David Carpenter to use his "Everything" Icon for this Skin.

# What makes this search bar different from others?
1. Search bars normally don't fit in your current skin setting and it makes it quite difficult to
 adjust the skin image with your image editing software. This search bar skin is different because
 it don't uses even one image and you can change the appearance very easily with just 2 variables
 to fit it to your settings.
2. If you make a selection in other search bars the selection will be dropped if you redraw your
 skin and it will automatically select the initial standard setting. I made this skin able to save
 it's current setting if you wish and not to save it's current setting if you don't wish. Besides
 you can also set a standard setting that will always be set if the skin is redrawn.

# How to use?
1. It's a Rainmeter skin you need Rainmeter
2. You need "[Everything](http://bgd69.deviantart.com/art/Search-425781470)" installed and/or "[Total Commander](https://www.ghisler.com)Total Commander"
3. Install the *.rmskin file
4. Important! Edit the "SearchBar.cfg" to your needs. Add the drives you want and the correct
 program paths. Keep it LUA language conform (normally you just need to know that you have to
 use double backslashes instead of single backslashes)
