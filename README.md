# RainmeterSkin: SearchBar Everything + TC
This is a small little Rainmeter search bar skin for the program "Everything"
and "Total Commander" to make fast searches on specified drives and folder or
files directly from the desktop.

This skin is inspired from "[Search+](http://bgd69.deviantart.com/art/Search-425781470)" skin by Bgd69.

Special thanks goes to Christian Gishler for the permission to use his
"Total Commander" Icon and David Carpenter to use his "Everything" icon for this
skin.

# What makes this search bar different from others?
1. Easily scalable for high dpi screens.
2. Easily customizable for your current skin setting (color, font...).
2. Saves current skin settings if closed.

# How to use?
1. It's a Rainmeter skin you need "[Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/)"
2. You need "[Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/)"
   installed and/or "[Total Commander](https://www.ghisler.com)"
3. Install the *.rmskin file
4. Important! Edit the "SearchBar.cfg" to your needs. Add the drives you want
   and the correct program paths. Keep it LUA language conform (normally you
   just need to know that you have to use double backslashes instead of single
   backslashes)
5. If you wish, change appearance (color, size...) in the skin ini file.
