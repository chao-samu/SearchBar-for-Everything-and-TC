#So many Files which one do i really need?
You need only two.

"SearchBar.cfg.lua"     --> edit for technical things
"Searchbar<flavor>.ini" --> edit for appearance of the skin

You can reach the ini file for appearance easily with right clicking on the
active skin and choose "edit Skin".

You can reach the .cfg file for technical things easily with right clicking
on the active skin, and choose the bold name. Then you should see the file and
you should open it with an editor.



# How can I change the color of the Skin?
Open ini file and search for "BackgroundColor=255,255,255,255"
This are RGBA values, google it if you don't know what it is.

For green for example set "BackgroundColor=0,255,0,255".
Save the file and Renew the Skin! Renew is important
(Right-click on the skin--> "skin renew")!



# How can I add my drives?
Open cfg file and search for "drives="
Just delete or add the one you need.

Save the file and Renew the Skin! Renew is important
(Right-click on the Skin--> "skin renew")!



# totalcommander or doublecommander plugin is not working, a weird dialogue opens?
You need Autohotkey installed to get it to work. (https://www.autohotkey.com/)
Also you need the required program "Total Commander" or "Double Commander" 
installed!
Also the Path must be correct look in section "Everything" is not working, if
you need help for the Path adjustment.



# Everything is not working?
Be sure everything is installed (https://www.voidtools.com/).
Also the path to the program have to be correct. If it's not the default path,
edit "SearchBar.cfg.lua", go to plugin override section --> remove "--" to
uncomment and edit the line "cmd" to the path where everything is!

everything = {
name = 'everything',
size = 1,
icon = SKIN:GetVariable('@')..'plugins\\Everything\\icon\\png\\',
field1 = drives,
field2 = { 'ALL' , 'FOLDER', 'FILE' },
text = 'Search Everything',
field1_cmd = {},
field2_cmd = { '', 'folder:', 'file:' },
cmd = SKIN:ReplaceVariables('C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Everything\\Everything.exe'),
additional = {drive = {}}
}

Don't forget the renew the Skin! Try it.


# Can I change the the websearch plugin to search with DuckDuckGo?
Yes, use the plugin override in the cfg file "SearchBar.cfg.lua".

Comment it out (remove "--" for the whole table and set "cmd" and "text"). So it
should look like this:

websearch = {
name = 'websearch',
icon = SKIN:GetVariable('@')..'plugins\\websearch\\icon\\png\\',
field1 = {''},
field2 = {''},
text = 'Search with DuckDuckGo',
field1_cmd = {''},
field2_cmd = {''},
cmd = 'https://duckduckgo.com/?q=',
additional = {''}
}
