-- Config file for SearchBar Skin for Rainmeter
-- Keep it LUA language conform, because it's read as LUA code!
-- You have to use "\\" instead of "\" because of lua language!
-- Any change in this config file requires a skin renew to use the new settings!
-- Edit everything in "SYSTEM DEPENDEND VARIABLES" to your needs (drive,...)!







-- SYSTEM DEPENDEND VARIABLES (Change it to your needs!) ===========================================

-- drives, you can add as many as you want (first index 'ALL' cannot be changed!)
drive = { 'ALL', 'C:\\', 'D:\\', 'E:\\' }

-- programm paths
PathEverything = SKIN:ReplaceVariables('C:\\Program Files\\Everything\\Everything.exe')
PathTC = SKIN:ReplaceVariables('C:\\totalcmd\\TOTALCMD64.EXE')

-- save current setting if skin is closed (set it to "true" or "false")
-- you can set your start settings under counter, but set it always >= 1 !
savesettings = false







-- SYSTEM INDEPENDEND VARIABLES (No changes needed here!) ==========================================

-- image paths
ImageNameEverything = SKIN:ReplaceVariables('#@#images\\_converted to png\\24x24_Everything-1.4.1.877.x64-Setup.png')
ImageNameTC = SKIN:ReplaceVariables('#@#images\\_converted to png\\24x24_AppIcon6.png')

-- scripts paths
PathTCScript = SKIN:ReplaceVariables('#@#AHKScripts\\TC-search-rainmeter.exe')

-- SearchScope
sScope = { 'ALL' , 'FOLDER', 'FILE' }
sScopeEverything = { '', 'folder:', 'file:' }
sScopeTC = {'-A', '-V', '-F' }

-- counter (every counter must be at least one!, because table index starts at 1 not 0)
count = 1 -- for ProgrammICON (1=TC; 2=Everything)
count2 = 1 -- for driveICON (1=ALL; every additional see drive variable)
count3 = 1 -- for SearchScopeICON (1=ALL; 2=FOLDER, 3=FILE)
